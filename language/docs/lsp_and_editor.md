## 2. LSP Features

### 2.1 Syntax Highlighting
- Token-based highlighting using the lexer output
- Custom themes for Glyph keywords, types, ECS constructs

### 2.2 Autocomplete (IntelliSense)
- Context-aware suggestions for keywords, identifiers, types, functions, components, etc.
- Snippet support for common patterns (entity, system, etc.)

### 2.3 Go-to-Definition & Find References
- Jump to symbol definitions (variables, functions, entities, components, etc.)
- List all references/usages in the project

### 2.4 Hover Documentation
- Show doc comments (`///`) and type info on hover
- Display function signatures, parameter info, and ECS metadata

### 2.5 Diagnostics (Errors & Warnings)
- Real-time reporting of syntax, semantic, and runtime errors
- Inline and panel display of diagnostics
- Warnings for best practices, unused variables, shadowing, etc.

### 2.6 Formatting
- Auto-format code to match style guide (indentation, spacing, etc.)
- On-save and manual formatting triggers

### 2.7 Refactoring Tools
- Rename symbol, extract function/component, inline variable, etc.
- Safe refactoring with preview and undo

### 2.8 Code Actions & Quick Fixes
- Suggest and apply fixes for common errors (e.g., missing import, type mismatch)
- Convert between code and visual scripting nodes

### 2.9 Visual Scripting Sync
- Bi-directional sync between code and node graph (AST ↔ Node)
- Highlight corresponding code/node on selection
- Live update of both views during editing

---

## 3. LSP Architecture

- The LSP server is built on top of the Glyph parser and semantic analyzer
- Exposes APIs for:
  - Tokenization and syntax tree queries
  - Symbol table and type info
  - Diagnostics and error reporting
  - Refactoring and code actions
  - Documentation extraction
- Communicates with editors via standard LSP protocol (JSON-RPC)

## 4. Editor Integration

### Monaco Editor
- Used in Glyph Studio for in-app editing
- Integrates with LSP for all features
- Custom themes, keybindings, and dockable panels

### VSCode Extension
- Provides Glyph language support in VSCode
- Bundles LSP server, formatter, and snippets
- Supports debugging, test running, and visual scripting preview

### Other Editors
- LSP-compatible editors (e.g., Neovim, Sublime) can use the Glyph LSP server

---

## 5. Live Error Reporting & Code Actions
- Errors and warnings update in real time as the user types
- Quick fixes and suggestions are shown inline or in a panel
- Clicking on a diagnostic navigates to the relevant code

---

## 6. Visual Scripting Integration
- Node graph view is kept in sync with code via AST mapping
- Editing nodes updates code, and vice versa
- Node validation errors are surfaced as diagnostics
- Drag-and-drop from code to node graph and back

---

## 7. Future Enhancements
- Inline variable/value preview (data tips)
- Collaborative editing (multi-user LSP sessions)
- AI-powered code completion and refactoring
- In-editor documentation and sample browser
