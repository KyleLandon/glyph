# Glyph Roadmap & Release Plan

This document outlines the phased roadmap and release plan for Glyph.

# Glyph Language – Roadmap & Release Plan

## 1. MVP Milestones (Phase 1)
- [ ] Core parser and lexer (supporting EBNF grammar)
- [ ] AST construction and semantic analyzer
- [ ] Interpreter for core language features (variables, functions, control flow)
- [ ] ECS basics: entity, component, system, queries
- [ ] Event system: emit/on, event types
- [ ] Standard library: math, string, list, dict, IO
- [ ] CLI tool: run, test, build, format
- [ ] Unit and integration test suite
- [ ] Monaco editor integration (basic syntax highlighting)
- [ ] Documentation: getting started, language tour, core concepts

**MVP Release Criteria:**
- All core features work end-to-end
- All sample programs run and pass tests
- Basic docs and editor support available

## 2. Phase 2: Advanced Language & Tooling
- [ ] Pattern matching, enums, traits/interfaces
- [ ] Async/await and concurrency primitives
- [ ] Macros and code generation
- [ ] Attribute/decorator support
- [ ] Visual scripting (AST ↔ node sync)
- [ ] LSP server: autocomplete, go-to-definition, diagnostics, formatting
- [ ] VSCode extension
- [ ] Debugger: breakpoints, stepping, variable inspection
- [ ] Expanded stdlib (collections, ECS helpers, input, net, time, os)
- [ ] CI/CD integration and code coverage
- [ ] Full documentation and tutorials

**Alpha/Beta Release Criteria:**
- All advanced features implemented and tested
