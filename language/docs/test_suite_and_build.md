# Glyph Language â€“ Test Suite & Build System Outline

## 1. Test Suite Organization

### 1.1 Unit Tests
- Test individual language features (parsing, type inference, pattern matching, etc.)
- Test standard library functions and modules
- Each test is isolated and repeatable

### 1.2 Integration Tests
- Test interactions between multiple features (ECS, events, async, etc.)
- Simulate real-world usage and sample projects

### 1.3 Regression Tests
- Ensure previously fixed bugs do not reappear
- Add tests for every reported issue

### 1.4 Standard Library Tests
- Comprehensive coverage for all stdlib modules and functions

### 1.5 Language Feature Tests
- Dedicated tests for new language constructs and syntax

---

## 2. Test Runner Design
- Built-in `test` blocks are collected and executed by the Glyph test runner
- Test runner supports:
  - Running all tests or a subset by name/tag
  - Reporting pass/fail, error messages, and stack traces
  - Outputting code coverage metrics
- CLI integration: `glyph test` command

**Sample Test Case:**
```glyph
test "addition works":
    assert 1 + 2 == 3
```

---

## 3. CI/CD Integration
- Automated test runs on every commit/pull request
- Integration with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.
- Fails builds on test failures or coverage drops
- Artifacts: test reports, coverage, build logs

---

## 4. Code Coverage
- Track which lines/branches are exercised by tests
- Minimum coverage thresholds enforced in CI
- Coverage reports viewable in editor and CI dashboard

---

## 5. Build System Notes

### 5.1 Compiling & Packaging
- `glyph build`: Compile source to bytecode or native binary
- `glyph package`: Bundle project for distribution (desktop, web, etc.)
- Versioning: Semantic versioning for language, stdlib, and CLI

### 5.2 CLI Tool
- `glyph run <file>`: Run a Glyph program
- `glyph test`: Run all tests
- `glyph build`: Compile project
- `glyph format`: Format code
- `glyph lint`: Lint code for style and errors
- `glyph doc`: Generate documentation

---

## 6. Example CI Workflow (GitHub Actions)
```yaml
name: Glyph CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Glyph
        run: |
          pip install glyphlang  # or appropriate installer
      - name: Run tests
        run: glyph test
      - name: Check coverage
        run: glyph coverage --fail-under=90
```

---

This structure ensures Glyph is robust, reliable, and easy to maintain as it evolves.
